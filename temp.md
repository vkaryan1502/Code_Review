❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum() { return a + b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` attempts to add `a` and `b` without these variables being defined within the function's scope or
passed as arguments. This will lead to an error because `a` and `b` are undefined.

✅ Recommended Fix:
```javascript
function sum(a, b) { return a + b; }
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ The function now accepts `a` and `b` as parameters, resolving the issue of undefined variables.
* ✔ This version of the function is reusable and can sum any two numbers passed to it.
